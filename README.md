# SaltyNX

Background process for the Nintendo Switch for file/code modification

Created by: https://github.com/shinyquagsire23

This fork includes many QoL improvements and beside plugins support also supports patches. 

Since 0.7.0 version NX-FPS and ReverseNX-RT are an intergral part of SaltyNX Core.<br>
Since 1.0.0 32-bit games are supported (plugins are not supported for them).<br>
To use ReverseNX-RT download newest overlay from [HERE](https://github.com/masagrator/ReverseNX-RT/releases)

Patches pattern:
- filename is symbol of function with filetype `.asm64` for 64-bit games, `.asm32` for 32-bit games,
- inside file write with hex editor instructions that you want to overwrite for this function,
- put this file either to `SaltySD/patches` to make it work for every game, or to `SaltySD/patches/*titleid*` to make it work for specific game.

For additional functions you need SaltyNX-Tool

https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX-Tool

It is required to have FW installed at least 10.0.0 version

No technical support for:
- Atmosphere forks
- SX OS
- Kosmos
- ReinX

Known issues:
- Instability with some homebrews and sysmodules (like emuiibo),
- You need to have at least Hekate 5.0.2 if you don't want issues related to Hekate,
- Cheats using directly heap addresses may not work properly while using plugins.

# How to download release:

For Atmosphere >=0.10.1 just put folders from archive to root of your sdcard.

For Atmosphere <=0.9.4 and any other CFW rename `contents` folder to `titles`

Remember to restart Switch

# Thanks to
- `Cooler3D` for sharing code with me how he was changing display refresh rate in his tools that were first publicly available tools allowing this on HOS. I have used that as basis to make my own function.
